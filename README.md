# OpenGL-Parallel-Programming
A project to play around with open gl's parallel programming capabilities. Currently a basic particle physics sim.

This was originally supposed to be a fluid sim, but sadly I'm not smart enough to understand the math behind that yet, so this is just a particle physics demo for now.
In the future I might optimize this, currently the cpu is doing too many calculations (neighbour checking for example).

To build, download the repo and double click the GenerateProjectFiles.bat file to generate the sln (using premake for the build system).
